**This is a responsive website**

https://loremipsum.io/  
  
^- lorem ipsum comes from the latin 
         dolorem ipsum which roughly translates:
                                           "Pain itself".

Mainly using html & css with a little javascript

Once this is completed will probably try and implement react?

remember this is a side, side project... but also a main focus among others
like the linked in profile.. still need to do that. 
also the GitHub IO page for Aznable-697....are we even sticking with that
Username??? 
   Possible username:
                    mattwhiteker ?
                    mswhiteker ?
                    therealmattwhiteker ?
                    



Main focus is the Java class. Spring boot & hibernate.

Also anyway to make some extra money or money period coding would be a plus...

so focus on java class and probably learn about **micro services**...

NEED A DAMN STUDIO NAME... -,- WSC? Whiteker software Co. ? Challenges Coding ?
